This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This APP uses the Clarifai API to detect faces, saves user data into a postgreSQL db through a NodeJS Server. This was from a Udemy course. I'm not deploying this or cleaning up the code further because I was doing this project to review / update my current knowledge with ReactJS, PostgresSQL, and NodeJS. 

My focus for learning is to build e-commerce sites, and will put more effort towards those projects.
